# Diabetis-prediction-with-XGBoost
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It leverages XGBoost, one of the most powerful classification algorithms, and integrates preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques.
